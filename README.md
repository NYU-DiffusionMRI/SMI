# Standard Model Imaging (SMI) toolbox
## This MATLAB toolbox contains all necessary functions for parameter estimation of the Standard Model of diffusion in white matter

### The Standard Model of diffusion in white matter
Multiple approaches to model the physics of water diffusion in white matter rely on similar assumptions. This led to the unifying framework dubbed Standard Model (SM) of diffusion in WM as formulated in (Reisert et al., 2017; Novikov et al., 2018, 2019).
Consider an elementary fiber segment or fiber fascicle, which is a local bundle of aligned sticks with the extra-neurite space surrounding them. The signal from such fascicle oriented along the unit vector nˆ, has contributions from two axially symmetric non-exchanging Gaussian compartments aligned along nˆ,


We recommend using the default options but the code is sufficiently flexible to provide users with some flexibility.

The current SMI implementation is written in Matlab, future work may translate it to other languages.
